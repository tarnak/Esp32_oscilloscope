**Want to try live demo? Demo ESP32 is available at [http://193.77.159.208/oscilloscope.html](http://193.77.159.208/oscilloscope.html). Please be lenient, ESP32 is not primarily intended for WAN.**

The first picture has been generated by bouncing of an end switch. ESP32 Oscilloscope performed digitalRead-s after pin has been initialized in INPUT_PULLUP mode. The second picture shows noise coming from poorly regulated power supply. ESP32 Oscilloscope used analogRead-s on an unconnected pin.

ESP32 oscilloscope was first meant to be just a demonstration of the ESP32_web_ftp_telnet_server_template (https://github.com/BojanJurca/Esp32_web_ftp_telnet_server_template) capabilities and is still fully included there, but it seems to be
better off on its own. Only functionalities necessary for oscilloscope to work are used:

- **webServer** for HTTP and WS requests (oscilloscope uses WebSockets)

- **ftpServer** for uploading oscilloscope.html to ESP32

## Setup instructions

1. Copy all files in this package into Esp32_oscilloscope directory.
2. Open Esp32_oscilloscope.ino with Arduino IDE.
3. Find and change YOUR-STA-SSID to your WiFi SSID and YOUR-STA-PASSWORD to your WiFi password.
4. In your Arduino IDE under Tools|Board make sure you choose "ESP32 Dev Module" or a board allowing partition schemes
5. Oscilloscope uses FAT file system so select one of FATFS partition schemas (Arduino IDE under Tools|Partition Scheme|...)
6. Compile sketch and run it on your ESP32 for the first time. Doing this, ESP32 flash memory will be formatted with FAT file system. WARNING: every information you have stored into ESP32â€™s flash memory will be lost.
7. FTP to your ESP32 (By using ftp command line utility or Windows explorer. User name and password are not required) and upload the following files into /var/www/html directory:

   - android-192-osc.png,
   - apple-180-osc.png,
   - oscilloscope.html.

```
